```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Create 100 samples

First we am creating 100 sample values from a log-normal distribution with mu=1, sigma=0.25.

```{r sampling}

samples<-rlnorm(100, meanlog=1, sdlog=0.25)

```

## Create Histogram

Then we plot our sample data into a histogram

```{r Histogram}

hist(samples)

plot(hist(samples))

```

## Distribution on the log scale

We plot the distribution on the log scale for the samples

```{r Distribution}

hist(log(samples))

plot(hist(log(samples)))

```

## mean and variance

We are providing the mean and variance of our exercise1b samples.


```{r mean and variance}

mean(samples)

var(samples)

```






## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
