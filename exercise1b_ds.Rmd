```

## Create 100 samples

First we am creating 100 sample values from a log-normal distribution with mu=1, sigma=0.25.

```{r sampling}

samples<-rlnorm(100, meanlog=1, sdlog=0.25)

```

## Create Histogram

Then we plot our sample data into a histogram

```{r Histogram}

hist(samples)

```

## Distribution on the log scale

We plot the distribution on the log scale for the samples

```{r Distribution}

hist(log(samples))

```

## mean and variance

We are providing the mean and variance of our exercise1b samples.


```{r mean and variance}

mean(samples)

var(samples)

```
